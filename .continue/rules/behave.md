Always use @File Tree before answering anything about file paths or structure.
Never invent file paths. If a file is not visible in @File Tree, say “not found in tree.”
Do not create new files unless explicitly instructed. If you think a new file is required, propose the exact path and ask first.
When asked to change code, make the smallest possible diff. Do not refactor unrelated code.
Only touch files I explicitly attach with @File, unless I say “you may open other files.”
